## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

steps

 > make
 // all the java files will be compiled & the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default and all the java classes will be generated in seperated folders ast, csem, parser & scanner

 >java rpal20 <filename.extension>

* If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
